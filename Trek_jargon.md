Crossover shunt

A shunt resistor is used to measure electric current, alternating or direct. This is done by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor. 
device to measure electric current is called an ammeter. Most modern ammeters measure the voltage drop over a precision resistor with a known resistance. The current flow is calculated by using Ohm’s law: $$I = \frac{V}{R} $$

Computer analyze subprogram “x”, → requested subprogram is a series of bi-directional data transfer & monitoring commands

Bypass the primary command pathway and cross connect the backup with the ODN

Computer simulations: the degree of temporal displacement is directly proportional to the number of chroniton particles interacting with the transporter beam
