Crossover shunt

A shunt resistor is used to measure electric current, alternating or direct. This is done by measuring the voltage drop across the resistor. 
device to measure electric current is called an ammeter. Most modern ammeters measure the voltage drop over a precision resistor with a known resistance. The current flow is calculated by using Ohm’s law: $$I = \frac{V}{R} $$
